<p> The flag of Zambia, which was first hoisted at midnight on October 23, 1964, serves as a symbol of the nation's patriotism and wealth. The flag's predominant color is green, representing Zambia's rich natural resources. An orange-colored eagle in flight is prominently displayed above a rectangular block that consists of three vertical stripes in red, black, and orange. The red stripe symbolizes the struggle for freedom, the black stripe represents the people of Zambia, and the orange stripe stands for the country's mineral wealth. The overall design of the flag reflects the pride and aspirations of the Zambian people.</p>
